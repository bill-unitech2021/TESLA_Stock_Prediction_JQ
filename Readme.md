## Usage

### 1. Import Data
- Load your stock data (e.g., `TSLA.csv`) through the **File** menu or toolbar.
- The application supports CSV files with columns: `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`.

### 2. Select Models
- Choose from a variety of models in the **Model Selection** panel.
- Customize training parameters such as date range and sequence length.

### 3. Train Models
- Train individual models or all selected models at once.
- Monitor training progress in real-time.

### 4. Predict Stock Prices
- Use trained models to predict future stock prices.
- Visualize predictions alongside historical data in interactive charts.

### 5. Evaluate Performance
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE).
- Save trained models for future use.

## Models Overview

| Model                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ARIMA**              | Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average for time series forecasting.       |
| **SARIMA**             | Seasonal ARIMA for capturing seasonal trends in stock data.                 |
| **Prophet**            | Facebook's time series forecasting model, ideal for stock price prediction. |
| **LSTM**               | Long Short-Term Memory neural network for sequential data.                  |
| **GRU**                | Gated Recurrent Unit, a simpler alternative to LSTM.                        |
